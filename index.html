    <!--Here I place the lyrics for the first verse and the pre-chorus in version 1.0-->
    <p>We're no strangers to love,
        You know the rules and so do I (Do I)</p>
    <p>A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy</p>
    <p>I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling,
        Gotta make you understand</p>
    <!--Below is my container that holds the "chorus" function I created in chorus.js-->

    <!--Below I have updated the correct second verse lyrics-->
    <p>We've known each other for so long
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (To say it)</p>
    <p>Inside, we both know what's been going on (Going on)
        We know the game, and we're gonna play it</p>
